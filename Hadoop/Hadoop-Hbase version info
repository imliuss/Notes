2.Java与HBase版本对应关系
HBase Version	              JDK 6	               JDK 7	                    JDK 8
1.2                     Not Supported             yes                        yes
1.1                     Not Supported             yes                     Running with JDK 8 will work but is not well tested.
1.0                     Not Supported             yes                     Running with JDK 8 will work but is not well tested.
0.98                        yes                   yes                     Running with JDK 8 works but is not well tested. Building with JDK 8 would require removal of the deprecated remove() method of the PoolMap class and is under consideration. See HBASE-7608 for more information about JDK 8 support.
0.94                        yes                   yes                        N/A
